# Introduction

Plywood is a lightweight, easy-to-use, general-purpose, cross-platform C++ library with minimal dependencies. All you need is a C++14 compiler and a supported platform SDK.

It's a complete alternative to the C and C++ Standard Libraries that packs a lot of features into a small code size, helping you build software that's easier to understand, distribute and maintain.

If you're new to C++, Plywood offers a simple interface to help you get up to speed writing efficient native applications quickly.

If you're an experienced C++ programmer, everything in Plywood should feel familiar. It's easy to integrate and coexists well with other libraries, so you can use it as the basis of new projects or adopt it incrementally in existing projects.
